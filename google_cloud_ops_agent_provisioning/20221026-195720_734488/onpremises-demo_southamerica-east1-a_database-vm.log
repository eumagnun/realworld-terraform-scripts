Recommendation: To check for possible causes of SSH connectivity issues and get
recommendations, rerun the ssh command with the --troubleshoot option.

gcloud compute ssh database-vm --project=onpremises-demo --zone=southamerica-east1-a --troubleshoot

Or, to investigate an IAP tunneling issue:

gcloud compute ssh database-vm --project=onpremises-demo --zone=southamerica-east1-a --troubleshoot --tunnel-through-iap

ERROR: (gcloud.compute.ssh) [/usr/bin/ssh] exited with return code [255].
